                            Sooner or later you will be asked to act as a marker in a game of Singles. As a marker you must
                            know your duties. These include:
                        </div>
                        <br>
                        <div>
                            <strong>PRE-MATCH</strong>
                            <span style="font-size: 1rem;"></span>
                        </div>
                        <div>
                            1.Make sure that you are always fully dressed in your whites, that you have a measure, a
                            piece of chalk, a pen or pencil and a wedge.
                        </div>
                        <div>
                            2. Introduce yourself to the two players.
                        </div>
                        <div>
                            3. Make sure that you can identify each player’s bowls.
                        </div>
                        <div>
                            4. Ask the players if they would like you to remove their non-touching bowls from the ditch.
                            You may only remove dead bowls from the green and the ditch with the agreement of both
                            opponents.
                        </div>
                        <div>
                            5. Advise them you will mark touches immediately before the next bowl is to be bowled.
                        </div>
                        <div>
                            6. The toss is the responsibility of the players not the marker.
                        </div>
                        <div>
                            7. Check if they would like any trial ends, if so how many ends and bowls per end they
                            intend bowling and were they would like the jack placed.
                        </div>
                        <div>
                            8. During trail ends place the jack where the player requires it and do not stop the bowl
                            if it strikes the jack. Allow it to come to rest and then re-set the jack.
                        </div>
                        <div>
                            9. You must pace out their distance from the jack in a straight line from the jack towards
                            the player if they are short and from the bowl to the jack if long, in order to show them
                            how short or long their bowls were. Do not kick the bowls, move them by hand.
                        </div>
                        <div>
                            10. During trial ends you can be asked anything.
                        </div>
                        <br>
                        <div>
                            <strong>DURING THE MATCH</strong>
                            <span style="font-size: 1rem;"></span>
                        </div>
                        <div>
                            11. Be alert at all times. Give your full attention to the game and do not indulge in
                            conversation with spectators or players on adjoining rinks. Do not daydream or watch other
                            matches.
                        </div>
                        <div>
                            12. During play you must stand 2 to 3 meters behind the jack and to one side, clear of the
                            white stakes. While a player is on the mat stand still and never stand on the bank unless
                            the jack is close to or in the ditch.
                        </div>
                        <div>
                            13. If a bowl touches your foot it is declared a dead bowl and is returned to the player
                            with an apology. If you disturb the head call an umpire immediately.
                        </div>
                        <div>
                            14. To call an umpire put your hand in the air and call out “umpire” loudly. If an umpire is
                            called stand back out of the head and do not get involved.
                        </div>
                        <div>
                            15. If the jack is bowled into the ditch, it is returned to the opponent.
                        </div>
                        <div>
                            16. If the jack is bowled within 2 meters of the ditch place it on the 2 meter mark.
                        </div>
                        <div>
                            17. If you think the jack is bowled less than 23 meters from mat, leave the decision to the
                            players and call for an umpires ruling if they request one.
                        </div>
                        <div>
                            18. If you think the jack is bowled out of bounds leave the decision to the players and call
                            for an umpires ruling if they request one.
                        </div>
                        <div>
                            19. When centering the jack do so with your hands. It is more precise.
                        </div>
                        <div>
                            20. Mark all touches with an X, including those that end up in the ditch. Keep an eye on the
                            next player and make one mark only.
                        </div>
                        <div>
                            21. A bowl is only a toucher if it makes contact with the jack in the course of its own
                            delivery. No knock-on's can be declared touches.
                        </div>
                        <div>
                            22. If a bowl is wobbling hold it when marking it or wait for it to fall over of its own
                            accord before marking it.
                        </div>
                        <div>
                            23. If the jack ends up in the ditch, mark its position on the bank with the white marker
                            provided.
                        </div>
                        <div>
                            24. At the completion of the end wait for the players, keep quite and wait for them to agree
                            on who has the shot and how many. At the conclusion of an end do not disturb any bowl as
                            only the player conceding the shots takes out the shot bowls.
                        </div>
                        <div>
                            25. Do not allow the head to be broken up until both players are agreed as to the shot or
                            shots.
                        </div>
                        <div>
                            26. Measuring is the player’s responsibility. You may measure doubtful shots when requested
                            by either player. When measuring, prop a bowl (use chalk if you do not have wedges) that
                            threatens to fall over. Call the umpire if in doubt.
                        </div>
                        <div>
                            27. If measuring and you want bowls removed from the head the players must remove them.
                            Never touch bowls or remove them from the head.
                        </div>
                        <div>
                            28. When measuring start from the closest bowl then measure the rest in the count.
                        </div>
                        <div>
                            29. Under no circumstances must you break up the head or help gather up the bowls.
                        </div>
                        <div>
                            30. Enter the score on the scorecard as soon as you are able. Indicate to the players the
                            state of the game. Update the scoreboard and double check it with the card after every end.
                        </div>
                        <div>
                            31. Pick up the mat if left in position by the players at the completion of the end.
                        </div>
                        <div>
                            32. Only a player on the mat can ask a question of you. A player can only ask one question
                            at a time.
                        </div>
                        <div>
                            33. When answering questions, only give answers to the question that has been asked. Never
                            volunteer any further information.
                        </div>
                        <div>
                            34. Unless requested, do not give an indication that there has been a change in the head.
                        </div>
                        <div>
                            35. Observe strict neutrality and volunteer no information or advice.
                        </div>
                        <div>
                            36. If asked for were the shot bowl is, point it out with your hand. Never give a foot as
                            this is not permitted.
                        </div>
                        <div>
                            37. If asked for distances show this by using your fingers or step the distance out, always
                            towards the player.
                        </div>
                        <div>
                            38. If asked how many shots a player is up or down, indicate this by a show of fingers or by
                            using the accepted hand signals.
                        </div>
                        <div>
                            39. You are not allowed to show any emotion which could be construed as favoritism for a
                            player.(i.e. by saying well bowled etc.).
                        </div>
                        <div>
                            40. If asked something you are not allowed to answer, simply ignore the request.
                        </div>
                        <br>
                        <div>
                            <strong>POST MATCH</strong>
                            <span style="font-size: 1rem;"></span>

                            42. See that the score card, containing the names of the players, is signed by the players,
                            includes the time of completion of the game and is disposed of according to the rules of the
                            competition.
