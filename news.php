                                        <br>
                                        It is some time since I put “pen to paper”, but there are some points to make.
                                        <br>
                                        Firstly welcome back to a new bowling season. To those of you that managed to
                                        get away from the rat race for a well-deserved break, welcome home.
                                        <br>
                                        I hope you all had a great Christmas and that the New Year gives you everything
                                        you hoped for. We are going to make 2018 even better than 2017.
                                        <br>
                                        We are very fortunate at Krugersdorp Bowling Club to have a great club with a
                                        good competitive club spirit; the committee, clubhouse, greens and grounds are
                                        the best in the district and our bowling performances overall, both in district
                                        and national competitions is improving all the time. Keep up the good work let
                                        us improve even more during the rest of the season.
                                        <br>
                                        The suggestion box at the end of the hall is there to be used. Any improvements
                                        you may think needs to be looked at and attended to, just complete the form and
                                        put it in the box. <ins>You will</ins> receive a written reply.

                                        I have a couple of items which I have already been mentioned over the past year
                                        or so, but I think need to be repeated.

                                        <strong>Calendar and Club Competitions</strong>
                                        <br>
                                        Our new bowling calendar is looking even more busy than usual. The Sables
                                        leagues restart at the end of January, which gives us some time to get our club
                                        competitions underway. The first couple of rounds of the club pairs have been
                                        completed and the next round must be finalised by the end of February. Rick,
                                        our Club Competition Secretary has been busy finalising the first few rounds of
                                        the Club singles games, the open, handicap and novices. We have until the end of
                                        January to complete these rounds. See the notice board for completion dates.
                                        <br>
                                        Already, after just a few games we have seen some surprising results, with I’m
                                        sure a lot more to come.
                                        <br>
                                        <br>
                                        <strong>Inclement Weather</strong>
                                        <br>
                                        Recently we had cause to ring the bell on the veranda and there seemed to be
                                        reluctance on the part of some players to leave the green. This is unacceptable.
                                        The club is responsible to ensure that nobody sustains an injury due to a
                                        lightning strike.
                                        <br>
                                        Krugersdorp BC has a Bye law which covers the event of lightning intervention
                                        however there are two vitally important points which I must make and by now you
                                        all must be aware of them.
                                        <br>
                                        1) The fact that the club is in possession of a “lightning meter” and
                                        <br>
                                        2) Should at any time the bell be rung, this means that lightning is in the
                                        vicinity and no further bowls may be played from that point.
                                        <br>
                                        <ins>No one is permitted to bowl another bowl.</ins> Everyone will leave the
                                        green as quickly as possible and move to the clubhouse for protection.
                                        <br>
                                        I must make it perfectly clear that if we are playing bowls, be it social,
                                        league or a district competition the above must happen. A storm can easily move
                                        20kms in a matter of minutes. The senior player from Krugersdorp BC will be
                                        responsible to ensure that green is vacated immediately.
                                        <br>
                                        <br>
                                        <strong>Umpires</strong>
                                        <br>
                                        When an umpire, if one is available, is called to the rink that you are playing
                                        on to confirm the shot bowl, give them space to do their job. It is not
                                        etiquette to stand and watch over their shoulder. Umpires are totally impartial
                                        and their word is final. Should an umpire not be available and someone is called
                                        from the next rink to assist the same applies, move away from the head let him
                                        do his job.

                                        We have just completed a few weeks of Sundowner Bowls. Dylan has to be
                                        congratulated on the format of play he devised.

                                        League will restart on the 27th January. Should we have any new or not so new
                                        bowlers who wish to be considered to play for the remainder of the season,
                                        please add your name to the league list or speak to one of the selectors.

                                        <br>
                                        It was good to see club members together with their friends and family attending
                                        this function. The breakfast was great and good value for money. My thanks to
                                        the Life Members of Krugersdorp Bowling club for putting in the effort to attend
                                        and making the day a special one. We are privileged to have active Life Members.
                                        Many clubs have Life members but they are there in name only and even members do
                                        not know who their Life Members are.

                                        This is our first function of the New Year. It will be taking place on the 25th
                                        January, starting at 08h00 with a breakfast, bowls then lunch. Don’t miss out,
                                        make sure you have entered your teams.

                                        <strong>Our Club and Improvements</strong>
                                        <br>
                                        If you take the time to look around, you will see that your new committee has
                                        been really busy making our club the best in the district. We sometimes take a
                                        lot for granted, the committee included. A few changes to mention are
                                        <br>
                                        1) The new extension to the bar now has some pictures of bowls on the walls
                                        together with a TV,
                                        <br>
                                        2) the veranda ceiling has been repainted,
                                        <br>
                                        3) the Suggestion Box,
                                        <br>
                                        4) the trophy cabinet has been relocated and we now have a
                                        <br>
                                        5) notice board with the bowls calendar,
                                        <br>
                                        6) new seating arrangements under the tree,
                                        <br>
                                        7) gates are now in fully working order. Ingrid has already sent us the code for
                                        the gate.
                                        <br>
                                        Matt has project sheet which as the project is completed it gets ticked off. As
                                        we raise money for the club so projects get completed.

                                        <strong>Social Bowls</strong>
                                        <br>
                                        We do on occasions receive complaints from members that the draw for social
                                        bowls has been fixed, is too one sided or not like it used to be years ago.
                                        Coenie is our Tabs Master and the draw is usually done under his supervision in
                                        the form of an open draw. The members who assist him do the draw to the best of
                                        their ability and as the grading’s allow.
                                        <br>
                                        Each members grading has recently looked at by our Selection Committee. On a
                                        social day all the tabs are laid out in sides from Skips to Leads. There are
                                        occasions where we have too many players in one or other of the categories, and
                                        in this instance some bowlers may find themselves playing in a position
                                        different to which they have been graded. 'Balancing' of the sides is frowned
                                        upon and will only take place when we have a player who is a specialist lead
                                        drawn against a new novice bowler. Even then on occasions this will backfire on
                                        you. Players are in and out of form even on a daily basis, so balancing even the
                                        so called obvious choices, e.g. our new bowlers, can be hopelessly wrong.
                                        <br>
                                        We have to believe that the grading’s are now correct or as close as they can
                                        be. As a final comment from me, we must all realize that this is social bowls.
                                        Many of our social bowlers are here for the exercise, a cup of tea and a chat
                                        and the eventual outcome of the game is of minor consequence. To play the game
                                        to the best of one’s ability have fun and enjoy the company you are in is what
                                        it’s all about. For the really competitive bowlers I say use social bowls as a
                                        practice, play shots you may not normally play and try for better consistency.
                                        To our new bowlers practice getting the line and weight right and to our Skips,
                                        relax and enjoy the game.

                                        games played on Sunday. The last few ends of the last game however got rained
                                        out by the traditional Joburg thundershower which I am sure was welcomed by
                                        many after the blistering heat that was experienced throughout the weekend.

                                        <strong>Fellow Members</strong><br>From a personal point of view part of May,
                                        June and Part of July is best forgotten about, but here we are into August
                                        already. The winter months are almost behind us and spring is around the corner.
                                        <br>
                                        There are a few items I have to bring to your attention.
                                        <br>
                                        <br>
                                        <strong>Club News</strong>
                                        <br>
                                        Our AGM is taking place at the club on the Saturday 30th September 2017 at
                                        14h00. Closing date for nominations is the 1st September. After taking a look at
                                        the notice board I see that only the Executive Members e.g. President, Vice
                                        President, Treasurer and Secretary and four committee members are up for
                                        election at this time. It is the time of the year when all of us should be
                                        thinking about our club representatives for the coming season. For our new
                                        members, remember that although someone has been nominated for a particular
                                        position, should there be more than the required number of nominees for that
                                        position on the day of the AGM; it will go to the vote. (E.g. if we require six
                                        nominations for the main committee and there are seven nominees the members
                                        present will be asked to vote for the six they think will be the most suitable).
                                        <br>
                                        It is important to remember that should you accept your nomination, your full
                                        commitment for the whole year would be appreciated.

                                        I was asked by a player whether or not they would be eligible to be a Club
                                        Selector. For the position of Club Selector, both Ladies and Men, you will be
                                        required to meet certain requirements. These are printed on the nomination form
                                        for Club Selector.

                                        Do not forget to pay your subs or part thereof prior to the date of the AGM.
                                        This will allow you to take part in any of the discussions and any voting that
                                        may be required. Remember that you may pay your subs over a period of time so
                                        please discuss and make the necessary arrangements with the President, Hon.
                                        Treasurer or Hon. Secretary.

                                        Club competitions have been completed and our Accolades evening will take place

                                        The league lists for both the Ladies and Men are on the notice board. We have
                                        had two league practice sessions, one I thought was quite successful the second
                                        not so good, mainly due to lack of attendance.

                                        Your current selectors have a meeting on the 3rd August to discuss the way
                                        forward, with regard to practice sessions. Sides will probably be selected prior
                                        to the day to ensure a good attendance. However I will keep you informed as the
                                        decision of the meeting.

                                        <br>
                                        I have not been around much during the past few weeks to play bowls but on
                                        occasions I have watched many of you play. I have been impressed on the steady
                                        improvement in the bowls, both in consistency and accuracy. Well done, keep it
                                        up. Since I’ve been back, playing I also took particular notice on the way
                                        players were reading the head and calling the shots, and again, well done.
                                        <br>
                                        During the Drawn Pairs last weekend, “slow play” was brought up. If we deem this
                                        to be necessary it should be included in our Conditions of Play. I personally
                                        have never had to refer to the “slow play “clause. From what I know and read in
                                        the Laws of The Game, this features mainly in games that are being played to a
                                        time limit e.g. a fifteen end game must be completed in two and a quarter hours,
                                        or by a certain time, where the side winning the game could play for time. I am
                                        not going into the rules here it would take up too much space, however should
                                        anyone wish to talk about it, please speak to me or one of the our other
                                        umpires. (In the new Laws of the Game, Third Edition (yellow) it is clause A5 –
                                        Delaying (slow) Play).

                                        One of the problems with our coaching is that we tell the new bowler to take
                                        their time on the mat ensuring that your feet, stance, bowl, delivery and line
                                        are all correct. Maybe we should also tell them that they must bowl their bowl
                                        without any undue delay, thirty-forty seconds should be plenty of time.

                                        <strong>Sables</strong>
                                        <br>
                                        Many of you will have heard a rumour going around regarding the future of Sables
                                        District. Our present District Executive will know more about what is likely to
                                        happen after their next two meetings, one with the other districts concerned and
                                        Gauteng Bowls and the other with Government representatives. By mid-August we
                                        should have some idea of what is going to transpire.
                                        <br>
                                        At this moment in time, let me say what I understand may happen in the near
                                        future.
                                        <br>
                                        At present Bowls SA have nineteen or twenty Districts e.g. Sables, Ekurhuleni,
                                        Port Natal, Limpopo, North West etc. In order for the government to allocate
                                        funds towards sport in the current nine Provinces, all sporting / bowling clubs
                                        will have to fall within one or other of the nine provinces.
                                        <br>
                                        It just so happens that at this time, in Sables, Maraisburg, Florida North,
                                        Leases, Discovery, RCC, Witpoortjie, and Honeydew Bowling Clubs fall within
                                        Johannesburg Municipal Boundary of Gauteng. Logically this may mean that they
                                        will be no longer part of Sables and will play their League, District
                                        Competitions and Provincials as part of, and be subject to, the conditions
                                        applicable to JBA (Bowls Gauteng).
                                        <br>
                                        Rustenburg will, I assume now fall under North West.
                                        <br>
                                        The remaining Sables Bowling Clubs, Krugersdorp, Noordheuwel and Randfontein,
                                        are located in Mogale City and therefore not eligible, at this time to play in
                                        the Province of Gauteng. These three clubs will be all that is left of the
                                        Sables Bowling Association.
                                        <br>
                                        Needless to say, there will be many discussions coming up and decisions will
                                        have to be made and negotiated over the next few months, with regard to the
                                        future of bowls in and around the areas of Roodepoort, Johannesburg and
                                        Krugersdorp.
                                        <br>
                                        The outcome of these meetings and the decisions made will be of vital importance
                                        to our club. Members will be kept informed of the progress on a regular basis.
                                        I can see many special meetings taking place to ensure that the bowls at
                                        Krugersdorp is not compromised in any way.

                                        Since I started this Newsletter, our President, Cobus, has spoken to the Sables
                                        District President, Mark Petzer and has been informed that this transformation
                                        may take up to five years to materialise. As I have said we will know more after
                                        the meeting on the 14th August.
                                        <br>
                                        There is some inevitability about the situation and we must prepare ourselves
                                        for some changes to our Sables District and the future of bowls.
